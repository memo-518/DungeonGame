# DungeonGame
A text based RPG that generates a dungeon for the player character to traverse, items for them to collect, and enemies for them to fight. This was the final project for CSCD 349 - Design Patterns at Eastern Washington University. It is built off of the work done in [cscd349Refactoring](https://github.com/rdeskins/cscd349Refactoring)

## Getting Started
Install Java, compile the files, and run DungeonAdventure.java to play the game.

## Tests
All tests in the [tests folder](https://github.com/rdeskins/DungeonGame/tree/master/DungeonSource/dungeon/tests) are JUnit tests.
